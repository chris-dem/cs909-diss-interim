  abstract = {Any proof of P!=NP will have to overcome two barriers: relativization and natural proofs. Yet over the last decade, we have seen circuit lower bounds (for example, that PP does not have linear-size circuits) that overcome both barriers simultaneously. So the question arises of whether there is a third barrier to progress on the central questions in complexity theory.In this paper we present such a barrier, which we call algebraic relativization or algebrization. The idea is that, when we relativize some complexity class inclusion, we should give the simulating machine access not only to an oracle A, but also to a low-degree extension of A over a finite field or ring.We systematically go through basic results and open problems in complexity theory to delineate the power of the new algebrization barrier. First, we show that all known non-relativizing results based on arithmetization -- both inclusions such as IP=PSPACE and MIP=NEXP, and separations such as MAEXP not in P/poly -- do indeed algebrize. Second, we show that almost all of the major open problems -- including P versus NP, P versus RP, and NEXP versus P/poly -- will require non-algebrizing techniques. In some cases algebrization seems to explain exactly why progress stopped where it did: for example, why we have superlinear circuit lower bounds for PromiseMA but not for NP.Our second set of results follows from lower bounds in a new model of algebraic query complexity, which we introduce in this paper and which is interesting in its own right. Some of our lower bounds use direct combinatorial and algebraic arguments, while others stem from a surprising connection between our model and communication complexity. Using this connection, we are also able to give an MA-protocol for the Inner Product function with O(sqrt(n) log n) communication (essentially matching a lower bound of Klauck).},

With probability 1, each of the relativized classes LOGSPACEA, PA, NPA, PPA, and PSPACEA is properly contained in the next. Also, NPA{$\neq$}co-NPA with probability 1. By contrast, with probability 1 the class PA coincides with the class BPPA of languages recognized by probabilistic oracle machines with error probability uniformly bounded below 12. NPA is shown, with probability 1, to contain a PA-immune set, i.e., a set having no infinite subset in PA. The relationship of PA-immunity to p-sparseness and NPA-completeness is briefly discussed: PA-immune sets in NPA can be sparse or moderately dense, but not co-sparse. Relativization with respect to a random length-preserving permutation {$\pi$}, instead of a random oracle A, yields analogous results and in addition the proper containment, with probability 1, of P{$\pi$} in NP{$\pi\cap$}co-NP{$\pi$}, which we have been unable to decide for a simple random oracle. Most of these results are shown by straightforward counting arguments, applied to oracle-dependent languages designed not to be recognizable without a large number of oracle calls. It is conjectured that all pA-invariant statements that are true with probability 1 of subrecursive language classes uniformly relativized to a random oracle are also true in the unrelativized case.}

  abstract = {We show that for several natural problems of interest, complexity lower bounds that are barely non-trivial imply super-polynomial or even exponential lower bounds in strong computational models. We term this phenomenon "hardness magnification". Our examples of hardness magnification include: 1. Let MCSP be the decision problem whose YES instances are truth tables of functions with circuit complexity at most s(n). We show that if MCSP[2{\textasciicircum}{\textsurd}n] cannot be solved on average with zero error by formulas of linear (or even sub-linear) size, then NP does not have polynomial-size formulas. In contrast, Hirahara and Santhanam (2017) recently showed that MCSP[2{\textasciicircum}{\textsurd}n] cannot be solved in the worst case by formulas of nearly quadratic size. 2. If there is a c {$>$} 0 such that for each positive integer d there is an {$\varepsilon$} {$>$} 0 such that the problem of checking if an n-vertex graph in the adjacency matrix representation has a vertex cover of size (log n){\textasciicircum}c cannot be solved by depth-d AC{\textasciicircum}0 circuits of size m{\textasciicircum}1+{$\varepsilon$}, where m = {$\Theta$}(n{\textasciicircum}2), then NP does not have polynomial-size formulas. 3. Let ({$\alpha$}, {$\beta$})-MCSP[s] be the promise problem whose YES instances are truth tables of functions that are {$\alpha$}-approximable by a circuit of size s(n), and whose NO instances are truth tables of functions that are not {$\beta$}-approximable by a circuit of size s(n). We show that for arbitrary 1/2 {$<$} {$\beta$} {$<$} {$\alpha$} {$\leq$} 1, if ({$\alpha$}, {$\beta$})-MCSP[2{\textasciicircum}{\textsurd}n] cannot be solved by randomized algorithms with random access to the input running in sublinear time, then NP is not contained in BPP. 4. If for each probabilistic quasi-linear time machine M using poly-logarithmic many random bits that is claimed to solve Satisfiability, there is a deterministic polynomial-time machine that on infinitely many input lengths n either identifies a satisfiable instance of bit-length n on which M does not accept with high probability or an unsatisfiable instance of bit-length n on which M does not reject with high probability, then NEXP is not contained in BPP. 5. Given functions s, c N {$\rightarrow$} N where s {$>$} c, let MKtP[c, s] be the promise problem whose YES instances are strings of Kt complexity at most c(N) and NO instances are strings of Kt complexity greater than s(N). We show that if there is a {$\delta$} {$>$} 0 such that for each {$\varepsilon$} {$>$} 0, MKtP[N{\textasciicircum}{$\varepsilon$}, N{\textasciicircum}{$\varepsilon$} + 5 log(N)] requires Boolean circuits of size N{\textasciicircum}1+{$\delta$}, then EXP is not contained in SIZE (poly). For each of the cases of magnification above, we observe that standard hardness assumptions imply much stronger lower bounds for these problems than we require for magnification. We further explore magnification as an avenue to proving strong lower bounds, and argue that magnification circumvents the "natural proofs" barrier of Razborov and Rudich (1997). Examining some standard proof techniques, we find that they fall just short of proving lower bounds via magnification. As one of our main open problems, we ask whether there are other meta-mathematical barriers to proving lower bounds that rule out approaches combining magnification with known techniques.},

However, the concept of NP-hardness cannot be applied to the rare problems where "every instance has a solution"---for example, in the case of games Nash's theorem asserts that every game has a mixed equilibrium (now known as the Nash equilibrium, in honor of that result).

Not only are there no known first-order methods converging to even approximate local min-max equilibria (a.k.a.\&nbsp;approximate saddle points), but the computational complexity of identifying them is also poorly understood. In this paper, we provide a characterization of the computational complexity as well as of the limitations of first-order methods in this problem. Specifically, we show that in linearly constrained min-max optimization problems with nonconvex-nonconcave objectives an approximate local min-max equilibrium of large enough approximation is guaranteed to exist, but computing such a point is PPAD-complete. The same is true of computing an approximate fixed point of the (Projected) Gradient Descent/Ascent update dynamics, which is computationally equivalent to computing approximate local min-max equilibria. An important byproduct of our proof is to establish an unconditional hardness result in the\&nbsp;Nemirovsky-Yudin 1983 oracle optimization model, where we are given oracle access to the values of some function f : P {$\rightarrow$} [-1, 1] and its gradient ∇ f, where P {$\subseteq$} [0, 1]d is a known convex polytope. We show that any algorithm that uses such first-order oracle access to f and finds an {$\varepsilon$}-approximate local min-max equilibrium needs to make a number of oracle queries that is exponential in at least one of 1/{$\varepsilon$}, L, G, or d, where L and G are respectively the smoothness and Lipschitzness of f. This comes in sharp contrast to minimization problems, where finding approximate local minima in the same setting can be done with Projected Gradient Descent using O(L/{$\varepsilon$}) many queries. Our result is the first to show an exponential separation between these two fundamental optimization problems in the oracle model.},

  abstract = {The current state-of-the-art methods for showing inapproximability in PPAD arise from the {$\varepsilon$}-Generalized-Circuit ({$\varepsilon$}-GCircuit) problem. Rubinstein (2018) showed that there exists a small unknown constant {$\varepsilon$} for which {$\varepsilon$}-GCircuit is PPAD-hard, and subsequent work has shown hardness results for other problems in PPAD by using {$\varepsilon$}-GCircuit as an intermediate problem.We introduce Pure-Circuit, a new intermediate problem for PPAD, which can be thought of as {$\varepsilon$}-GCircuit pushed to the limit as {$\varepsilon$} {$\rightarrow$} 1, and we show that the problem is PPAD-complete. We then prove that {$\varepsilon$}-GCircuit is PPAD-hard for all {$\varepsilon$} \&lt; 1/10 by a reduction from Pure-Circuit, and thus strengthen all prior work that has used GCircuit as an intermediate problem from the existential-constant regime to the large-constant regime.We show that stronger inapproximability results can be derived by reducing directly from Pure-Circuit. In particular, we prove tight inapproximability results for computing approximate Nash equilibria and approximate well-supported Nash equilibria in graphical games, for finding approximate well-supported Nash equilibria in polymatrix games, and for finding approximate equilibria in threshold games.},

No complete problem was known for CLS, and in previous work, the problems ContractionMap, i.e., the problem of finding an approximate fixpoint of a contraction map, and PLCP, i.e., the problem of solving a P-matrix Linear Complementarity Problem, were identified as prime candidates. First, we present a new CLS-complete problem MetaMetricContractionMap, which is closely related to the ContractionMap. Second, we introduce EndOfPotentialLine, which captures aspects of PPAD and PLS directly via a monotonic directed path, and show that EndOfPotentialLine is in CLS via a two-way reduction to EndOfMeteredLine. The latter was defined to keep track of how far a vertex is on the PPAD path via a restricted potential function. Third, we reduce PLCP to EndOfPotentialLine, thus making EndOfPotentialLine and EndOfMeteredLine at least as likely to be hard for CLS as PLCP. This last result leverages the monotonic structure of Lemke paths for PLCP problems, making EndOfPotentialLine a likely candidate to capture the exact complexity of PLCP; we note that the structure of Lemke-Howson paths for finding a Nash equilibrium in a two-player game very directly motivated the definition of the complexity class PPAD, which eventually ended up capturing this problem's complexity exactly.},

To remedy this problem, we introduce the function class GapP as a natural alternative to \#P. GapP is the closure of \#P under subtraction and has all the other useful closure properties of \#P as well. We show that most previously studied counting classes, including PP, C=P, and ModkP, are ``gap-definable,'' i.e., definable using the values of GapP functions alone. We show that there is a smallest gap-definable class, SPP, which is still large enough to contain Few. We also show that SPP consists of exactly those languages low for GapP, and thus SPP languages are low for any gap-definable class. These results unify and improve earlier disparate results of J. Cai and L. Hemachandra (Math. Systems Theory 23, No. 2 (1990), 95--106) and J. K{\"o}bler et al. (J. Comput. System Sci. 44, No. 2 (1992), 272--286). We show further that any countable collection of languages is contained in a unique minimum gap-definable class, which implies that the gap-definable classes form a lattice under inclusion. Subtraction seems necessary for this result, since nothing similar is known for the \#P-definable classes.},

The most well-known such problem is that of computing a Nash equilibrium of a game. Other examples include the search for market equilibria, and envy-free allocations in the context of cake-cutting. A problem is said to be complete for PPAD if it belongs to PPAD and can be shown to constitute one of the hardest computational challenges within that class. In this paper, I give a relatively informal overview of the proofs used in the PPAD-completeness results. The focus is on the mixed Nash equilibria guaranteed to exist by Nash's theorem. I also give an overview of some recent work that uses these ideas to show PSPACE-completeness for the computation of specific equilibria found by homotopy methods. I give a brief introduction to related problems of searching for market equilibria.},

  abstract = {The problem of constructing hazard-free Boolean circuits dates back to the 1940s and is an important problem in circuit design. Our main lower-bound result unconditionally shows the existence of functions whose circuit complexity is polynomially bounded while every hazard-free implementation is provably of exponential size. Previous lower bounds on the hazard-free complexity were only valid for depth 2 circuits. The same proof method yields that every subcubic implementation of Boolean matrix multiplication must have hazards. These results follow from a crucial structural insight: Hazard-free complexity is a natural generalization of monotone complexity to all (not necessarily monotone) Boolean functions. Thus, we can apply known monotone complexity lower bounds to find lower bounds on the hazard-free complexity. We also lift these methods from the monotone setting to prove exponential hazard-free complexity lower bounds for non-monotone functions. As our main upper-bound result we show how to efficiently convert a Boolean circuit into a bounded-bit hazard-free circuit with only a polynomially large blow-up in the number of gates. Previously, the best known method yielded exponentially large circuits in the worst case, so our algorithm gives an exponential improvement. As a side result we establish the NP-completeness of several hazard detection problems.},

This new game is both a generalization of the monotone Karchmer-Wigderson game and an analog of the classical Boolean Karchmer-Wigderson game. Therefore, it acts as a bridge between the existing monotone and general games. Using this game, we prove hazard-free formula size and depth lower bounds that are provably stronger than those possible by the standard technique of transferring results from monotone complexity in a black-box fashion. For the multiplexer function we give (1) a hazard-free formula of optimal size and (2) an improved low-depth hazard-free formula of almost optimal size and (3) a hazard-free formula with alternation depth \$2\$ that has optimal depth. We then use our optimal constructions to obtain an improved universal worst-case hazard-free formula size upper bound. We see our results as a significant step towards establishing hazard-free computation as an independent missing link between Boolean complexity and monotone complexity.},

We develop an approach to these problems through geometric invariant theory. The goal of this approach is to reduce the hard nonexistence problems under consideration to tractable existence problems. Accordingly, we reduce the arithmetic (characteristic 0) version of the P {$\neq$} NP conjecture, and other related lower bound problems to proving existence of obstructions. These are representations in the homogeneous coordinate rings of orbit-closures in geometric invariant theory [MFK], of a class of points which are partially stable and whose stabilizers have special representation-theoretic properties. However, the Luna-Vust complexity [LV] of these orbit closures is quite high, in contrast with the well-understood homogeneous or almost-homogeneous-spaces, such as G/P [LLM], toric varieties [F3], and spherical embed-dings [BLV], whose Luna-Vust complexity is zero. We take a step towards explicit construction of obstructions by proving two results regarding these orbit closures. The first is a generalization of the Borel-Weil theorem for G/P to these orbit-closures. Second, we conjecture a nice representation-theoretic set of generators for their ideals, and prove a weaker version of the conjecture. Such a set of generators had earlier been given for the ideal of G/P by Lakshmibai, Seshadri, Littelmann [LS, Li3, LLM] and Kostant (cf. [PK]). Finally, using these results, we reduce, in essence, the arithmetic non-existence problems under consideration to fundmental existence and construction problems in representation theory and algebraic geometry that are conjectured to be in the complexity class P.},

  abstract = {This article belongs to a series on geometric complexity theory (GCT), an approach to the P vs. NP and related problems through algebraic geometry and representation theory. The basic principle behind this approach is called the flip. In essence, it reduces the negative hypothesis in complexity theory (the lower bound problems), such as the P vs. NP problem in characteristic zero, to the positive hypothesis in complexity theory (the upper bound problems): specifically, to showing that the problems of deciding nonvanishing of the fundamental structural constants in representation theory and algebraic geometry, such as the well known plethysm constants--or rather certain relaxed forms of these decision probelms--belong to the complexity class P. In this article, we suggest a plan for implementing the flip, i.e., for showing that these relaxed decision problems belong to P. This is based on the reduction of the preceding complexity-theoretic positive hypotheses to mathematical positivity hypotheses: specifically, to showing that there exist positive formulae--i.e. formulae with nonnegative coefficients--for the structural constants under consideration and certain functions associated with them. These turn out be intimately related to the similar positivity properties of the Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials and the multiplicative structural constants of the canonical (global crystal) bases in the theory of Drinfeld-Jimbo quantum groups. The known proofs of these positivity properties depend on the Riemann hypothesis over finite fields and the related results. Thus the reduction here, in conjunction with the flip, in essence, says that the validity of the P vs. NP conjecture in characteristic zero is intimately linked to the Riemann hypothesis over finite fields and related problems.},

These are: (1) two concrete lower bounds, which are currently the best known lower bounds in the context of the P vs. NC and permanent vs. determinant problems, (2) the Flip Theorem, which formalizes the self-referential paradox in the P vs. NP problem, and (3) the Decomposition Theorem, which decomposes the arithmetic P vs. NP and permanent vs. determinant problems into subproblems without self-referential difficulty, consisting of positivity hypotheses in algebraic geometry and representation theory and easier hardness hypotheses.},

  abstract = {We define several new complexity classes of search problems, ``between'' the classes FP and FNP. These new classes are contained, along with factoring, and the class PLS, in the class TFNP of search problems in FNP that always have a witness. A problem in each of these new classes is defined in terms of an implicitly given, exponentially large graph. The existence of the solution sought is established via a simple graph-theoretic argument with an inefficiently constructive proof; for example, PLS can be thought of as corresponding to the lemma ``every dag has a sink.'' The new classes, are based on lemmata such as ``every graph has an even number of odd-degree nodes.'' They contain several important problems for which no polynomial time algorithm is presently known, including the computational versions of Sperner's lemma, Brouwer's fixpoint theorem, Ch{\'e}valley's theorem, and the Borsuk-Ulam theorem, the linear complementarity problem for P-matrices, finding a mixed equilibrium in a non-zero sum game, finding a second Hamilton circuit in a Hamiltonian cubic graph, a second Hamiltonian decomposition in a quartic graph, and others. Some of these problems are shown to be complete.},

Adapting a limitation of the approximation method obtained by Razborov, we show that in many cases it is not possible to combine the approximation method with typical (localizable) hardness magnification theorems to derive strong circuit lower bounds. In particular, one cannot use the approximation method to derive an extremely strong constant-depth circuit lower bound and then magnify it to an \$NC{\textasciicircum}1\$ lower bound for an explicit function. To prove this we show that lower bounds obtained by the approximation method are in many cases localizable in the sense that they imply lower bounds for circuits which are allowed to use arbitrarily powerful oracles with small fan-in.},

  abstract = {The canonical pair of a proof system \$P\$ is the pair of disjoint NP sets where one set is the set of all satisfiable CNF formulas and the other is the set of CNF formulas that have \$P\$-proofs bounded by some polynomial. We give a combinatorial characterization of the canonical pairs of depth{\textasciitilde}\$d\$ Frege systems. Our characterization is based on certain games, introduced in this article, that are parametrized by a number{\textasciitilde}\$k\$, also called the depth. We show that the canonical pair of a depth{\textasciitilde}\$d\$ Frege system is polynomially equivalent to the pair \$(A\_\{d+2\},B\_\{d+2\})\$ where \$A\_\{d+2\}\$ (respectively, \$B\_\{d+1\}\$) are depth \{\$d+1\$\} games in which Player{\textasciitilde}I (Player II) has a positional winning strategy. Although this characterization is stated in terms of games, we will show that these combinatorial structures can be viewed as generalizations of monotone Boolean circuits. In particular, depth{\textasciitilde}1 games are essentially monotone Boolean circuits. Thus we get a generalization of the monotone feasible interpolation for Resolution, which is a property that enables one to reduce the task of proving lower bounds on the size of refutations to lower bounds on the size of monotone Boolean circuits. However, we do not have a method yet for proving lower bounds on the size of depth{\textasciitilde}\$d\$ games for \$d{$>$}1\$.},

We argue that the known proofs of lower bounds on the complexity of explicit Boolean functions in nonmonotone models fall within our definition of natural. We show, based on a hardness assumption, that natural proofs can not prove superpolynomial lower bounds for general circuits. Without the hardness assumption, we are able to show that they can not prove exponential lower bounds (for general circuits) for the discrete logarithm problem. We show that the weaker class ofAC0-natural proofs which is sufficient to prove the parity lower bounds of Furst, Saxe, and Sipser, Yao, and H{\aa}stad is inherently incapable of proving the bounds of Razborov and Smolensky. We give some formal evidence that natural proofs are indeed natural by showing that every formal complexity measure, which can prove superpolynomial lower bounds for a single function, can do so for almost all functions, which is one of the two requirements of a natural proof in our sense.},
