To manage our software we are using \textit{Rust},
as the main language of development, due to its high expressibility and low level management.
We utilise methods such as Test-Driven-Development with the help of \texttt{Proptest}
for property testing and kanban boards to accurately track our progress as seen
in figure \ref{fig:soft:ecs-workflow}. Lastly we are making use of 
\textit{Bevy} which is a game engine that uses the Entity-Component-System
architecture to render interactions between entities as seen in \ref{fig:soft:ecs-workflow} \cite{bevyengine}.

With regards to the our research management, we revolved our work around obsidian.
As we can observe in the figure \ref{fig:theory:obsidian-usages}, 
\texttt{Obsidian} beyond its traditional usage of note taking, entails several handy tools such as note organisation and mind-mapping.

\subsection{Risk Management}

Due to the limited prior research on the counting complexity of $\textsc{\#TFNP} -1$,
this project involved significant risks.
Our justification for the proposed milestones was largely informed by existing knowledge regarding the complexity of circuit constructions.
However, it remained entirely possible that our proposed reductions could prove to be infeasible.
Furthermore, working with Kleene logic introduced additional complexity, and it maybe the reason why 
establishing fully parsimonious reductions between the target problems may not be achievable.
This is also the reason why we diverted our attention to bounded parsimonious reductions instead.
A detailed overview of the associated risks and our proposed mitigation strategies is provided in the table \ref{tab:management:risk-management}.

% From our table, it is worth expanding on some of the points. The best method
% we found when tackling this problem is when we try to uncover reductions between other
% \textsc{PPAD} problems or when trying to incorporate gadgets from Kleene theory. We hope
% that by experimenting enough we will be able to get close to resolve our conjectures.
