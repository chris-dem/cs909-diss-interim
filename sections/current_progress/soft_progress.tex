In our project we are also focused on developing a visualisation tool
for \textsc{PureCircuit} instances. 
In our introduction we referred to three main objectives. As of time of writing
w are close to the completion of the first one. We will provide a table of
objectives that have been achieved, as well as the remaining requirements needed
to complete the first milestone in \ref{tab:soft:rem-unrem-issues-stage1}. Lastly, we provide a figure
of our current visualisation in \ref{fig:soft:current-phases}

            Toggle between value nodes and gate nodes                                  & Specify the type of gate to add                                                                             \\ \hline
            Add edges. Ensure that edges can only be added between heterogeneous nodes & Add indicators as to how many edges are excess/remaining for the gate to be valid                           \\ \hline  
            Move whole graph                                                           & Inclusion of a status bar as to whether the current assignment is correct, wrong or syntactically incorrect \\  \hline
            Create panel to show current state as well as some indicator and guides    &   \\ \hline
