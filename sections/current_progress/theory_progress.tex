In the current section we will be focusing on progress made.
We experimented with various approach
such as investigating easier variants of \textsc{PureCircuit} to find reductions
to the \textsc{EndOfLine}. Moreover, we looked into using the \textsc{Purify} gate
or a variant where we have more control over the $\bot$ value but we
realised that under Marino et al. \cite{marino_GeneralTheoryMetastable_1981} continuity
arguments, such variants are not trivial to find.
Our core breakthrough, came when experimenting with
Hazard-Free circuits  and \textsc{EOPL} problems. Specifically,
we looked at a problem by Fearnley et al. \cite{fearnley_UniqueEndPotential_2020} where
they introduced a variant brouwer problems known as \textsc{OPDC}, which is a 
local descent problem with fixed point topologies. Combining ideas of the two 
lead to the main find of our project in \ref{sect:main-result}


% In addition, for the last point, we made several efforts to ensure our problem is
% \textsc{PPAD}-complete and combinatorial friendly, by trying to restrict the \textsc{Purify} gate. 
% We soon realised that any methods that detect the $\bot$ value or try to eliminate ultimately
% fail. The observation can be based on a continuity argument that Marino created
% \cite{marino_GeneralTheoryMetastable_1981} and in general any possible extensions or gates we can
% add seem to adhere continuity. 




\subsubsection{$\scn{nD-StrongSperner}$ Constant Parsimonious Reduction} \label{sect:main-result}

% Daskalakis et al. \cite{daskalakis_ComplexityComputingNash_2006} showed that we can find a parsimonious reduction between
% $\scn{EndOfLine}$ and $\scn{3D-Brouwer}$, which is a variant of $\scn{3D-StrongSperner}$ and is based on the same principal. Later on
% Chen et al. \cite{chen_Complexity2DDiscrete_2009} was able to show that it suffices to use 
% 2 dimensions by reducing the problem to a 2D planar graph variant of \textsc{EndOfLine}.
Deligkas et al. \cite{deligkas_PureCircuitTightInapproximability_2024} proved
\textsc{PPAD-hardness} by reducing from \textsc{StrongSperner} \ref{def:strong-sperner},
but with unbounded dimensions of polynomial width.
Our contribution parsimoniounsly constant reduces \ref{def:func-pars}
every $\scn{nD-StrongSperner}$ problem to  $\scn{PureCircuit}$. 
We will demonstrate our reduction for 3 dimensions and then we will generalise.

\begin{theorembox}{3D-StrongSperner to PureCircuit}{thm:strong-pure}
    $$
    \scn{\#3D-StrongSperner} \subseteq^{7} \scn{\#PureCircuit}
    $$
\end{theorembox}

When referring to the fact that $x$ is a solution, we imply the definition described in  \ref{def:nd-strong-sperner}.
Additionally we will restrict the solution set of the \textit{Purify} gate of \textsc{PureCircuit}
to $(0,\bot),(\bot, 1), (0,1), (1, \bot)$.  We explaind in \ref{par:pure-circ-def} why this
does not affect the \textsc{PPAD-hardness} of the problem nor any counting arguments.

\begin{proof} 
    The first step of the proof requires constructing a colouring function $\Lambda: (\mathbb{B}^{n+1})^3$ such that:
$$
\forall (i,j,k) \in (\mathbb{B}^{(n+1)})^3: \Lambda(i,j,k) \triangleq 
\lambda\left( \left\lfloor  \frac{{i+1}}{2}  \right\rfloor, \left\lfloor  \frac{{j+1}}{2} \right\rfloor, \left\lfloor  \frac{{k+1}}{2} \right\rfloor \right)  \\
$$

Conversely we can say that we map from our original domain to our new domain as such

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:trans-eq}
\forall  x \in \{ 0,1 \}^{3n}, i \subseteq \{ 0,1,2 \}: \lambda(x_{-i}, x_{i}) \to \Lambda(2x_{i}, 2x_{-i} -1)
\end{equation}

The transformation can be visualised in the figure \ref{fig:main-proof:set_mapping}.
The reasoning for doubling the dimensions will be explained in the later sections.

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{assets/1751381227.png}
\caption{Transformation of solutions. In the original cube we have as solutions $(0, i,j)$ and $(1, i,j)$. In our new mapping, these solutions correspond to
$(0, i,j), (2,i,j)$}
    \label{fig:main-proof:set_mapping}
\end{figure}

Given that $S$ is the original set of solution, we define the claim \ref{clm:trans-main}.

\begin{claimbox}{Transformation claim}{trans-main}
    \label{clm:main-proof:trans-claim}
    Given $S_{\text{even}}$ the set of even solutions or more formally:
    $$
        S_{\text{even}} \triangleq
        \Big\{(i0,j0,k0) \in (\mathbb{B}^{(n+1)})^3 \mid (i0,j0,k0) \text{ covers all labels by \ref{def:bipolar-colouring}} \Big\}
    $$
    We claim $|S| = |S_{\text{even}}|$
\end{claimbox}

\begin{proof}
    We argue that we can bijectively map between $S \leftrightarrow S_{\text{even}}$.
    To show the left to right direction, assume $(i,j,k) \in S$.
    Using equation \ref{eq:trans-eq}, only one transformation maps all points to even coordinates.
    Additonally, we can observe its neighbourhood set:
    $$
    N = \Big\{\Lambda(2i + x_1, 2j + x_2, 2k + x_3) \mid x \in \mathbb{B}^3 \Big\}
    $$
    We can observe that WLOG $\Lambda(2i + 1, \cdot, \cdot) = \lambda(i + 1, \cdot, \cdot)$, which implies:
    $$
    N = \Big\{\lambda(i + x_i, j + x_j, k + x_k) \mid x \in \mathbb{B}^3 \Big\}
    $$
    And therefore the the point is also a solution. Conversely we can use the previous neighbourhood argument to show the opposite
    direction.
\end{proof}
We will redefine $n + 1$ as $n$ to keep the notation consistent.
Given the above we provide a main sketch of our tranformation as such:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Input bits}: We initialize input nodes $s_1, s_2, s_3$
    \item \textbf{Bit generator}: We apply the \textit{Bit Generator gadget} $\hat{P}$ for each $s_i$,
        to create numbers $u^1, u^2, u^3 \in \mathbb{B}^{k}$
    \item \textbf{Circuit application}: We apply circuit $\bar{\Lambda}(u^1, u^2, u^3)$ to create output values $o_1, o_2, o_3$, where 
$\bar{\Lambda}$ is a 3-bit hazard-free variant of $\Lambda$.
    \item \textbf{Validation}: Copy the results to $s_1, s_2, s_3$
\end{enumerate}
The transformation can be summarised in the figure \ref{fig:main-proof:visualisation}.
The goal of the above transformation is to show that if $o_1 = o_2 =o_3 = \bot$, then we have a solution
to the original instance.

\begin{figure}[h!]

    \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{assets/reduction_sketch.png}
    \caption{Testing}
    \label{fig:main-proof:visualisation}
\end{figure}


\paragraph{Bit generator}

We create the gadget described in the figure \ref{fig:main-proof:purification}.

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth, clip]{assets/purification_generator.png}
    \caption{Bit generator gadget which is defined as a linear stack of $P$ gates.} 
    \label{fig:main-proof:purification}
\end{figure}
\FloatBarrier

Given that construction we make the following lemma

\begin{lemma}[Bit Generator Lemma]
    \label{lem:bit-gen}
    The following hold true in our construction:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item if $s_i = b \implies u^i = b^n$, given $b \in \mathbb{B}$
        \item if $s_i = \bot \implies \forall j \in [n-1]: u^i_j \in \mathbb{B}$ and $u^i_{n} \in \{1, \bot\}$
    \end{enumerate}
    The above translates to: if we have $\bot$ in our number, it can only be found in the LSB.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    The first part follows trivially from the defintion of the \scn{Purify} gate.
    To prove the second part of lemma, WLOG we choose $u^i$ out of the three outputs and
    assume $\exists j \in [n-1]: [u^i]_j = \bot$. It implies  that one of the purify gates had an output of $(\bot, 1)$.
    But due to our $\textsc{OR}$ gate, the input would be $1$ which implies the output is $1,1$, which leads to a contradiction.
\end{proof}


\paragraph{Circuit Application}

In the current phase, we apply a polynomial transformation to $\Lambda$ to be 3-bit hazard-free using the construction
by Ikenmeyer et al. \cite{ikenmeyer_ComplexityHazardfreeCircuits_2019} \textit{Corollary 10} or 
by \cite{bund_SmallHazardFreeTransducers_2025} \textit{Corollary 1.9}.
By lemma \ref{lem:bit-gen}, we can have at most 3 $\bot$ values 
in our input. Using that property we create the lemma below:

\begin{lemmabox}{Circuit Application Lemma}{circuit}
    Given $o_1 = o_2 = o_3 = \bot$ it implies $u^1, u^2, u^3$ correspond to a solution $(i0,j0,k0) \in S_\text{even}$
\end{lemmabox}


\begin{proof}
    First we argue that if $i\bot, j\bot, k\bot = u^1, u^2, u^3$, then
    its its resolutions can represent hypercubes as shown in figure \ref{fig:main-proof:cube-vis}.
    \begin{figure}[h!]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.2\textwidth]{assets/3d-cube.png}
        \caption{Resolutions of $i\bot, j\bot, k\bot$}\label{fig:main-proof:cube-vis}
    \end{figure}

    If $(i0, j0, k0)$ is a solution that implies:
    $$
    \forall i \in \{1,2,3\}, b \in \{-1, 1\} \exists c \in \textsc{Res}(i\bot, j\bot, k\bot): [\bar{\Lambda}(c)]_i = b
    $$
    Since $\bar{\Lambda}$ is 3-bit hazard free, if all outputs are $\bot$, we satisfy the colouring criteria.
\end{proof}
The above proof also demonstrates why the domain transformation we did in our first step is needed as we only
capture cubes with even smallest corners.  We can observe by fixing the LSB of the input to some value,
we extract a specific edge or face of the cube.


\begin{lemmabox}{Correctness lemma}{corr-lem}
    A valid assingment $x$ of the current instace, corresponds to a point in $S_{\text{even}}$
\end{lemmabox}

\begin{proof}
    It suffices to show that a valid assingment only occurs when $o_1 = o_2 = o_3 = \bot$. Assume
    $\exists i \in \{1,2,3\}$ such that label $i$ is not covered, meaning $o_i \neq \bot$.
    WLOG assume that $o_i = 0$. Our verification stage, will copy $0$ onto $s_i$. By lemma \ref{lem:bit-gen}, $u^{(i)} = 1^n$. From the boundary
    conditions of our circuits and the k-bit hazard-freeness construction,
    we know that $\Lambda(*, 0^n, *) = \{*, 1,  *\}$. But that implies
    $o_i = 1$ which leads to a contradiction. We can make a similar argument to when $o_i = 1$.
    Therefore, by \ref{lem:circuit}, if $o_1 = o_2 = \bot$, we have a found a panchromatic
    cube. Lastly, every assingment $u^1, u^2, u^3k$  corresponds to a cube with even corners.
\end{proof}

\end{proof}
\paragraph*{Counting Argument}
We observe that the LSB can only be $1,\bot$.
Moreover, we double count any edges or faces of the cube that cover all labels, which gives the equation:
$$
\underbrace{\binom{3}{1}}_{\substack{\text{One of the sides is odd} \\ \text{and covers all labels}}}
+ \underbrace{\binom{3}{2}}_{\substack{\text{One of the edges is odd} \\ \text{and covers all labels}}}
+ \underbrace{1}_{\text{All LSBs are } \bot} = 2^3 - 1 = 7
$$
Therefore, we can bound the number of solutions of \textsc{3D-StrongSperner} by a factor of $7$.


$\textsc{EndOfLine}$ problem parsimoniously reduces to $\textsc{2D-StrongSperner}$ and $\textsc{3D-StrongSperner}$
under \textbf{linear} colouring \cite{chen_Complexity2DDiscrete_2009, daskalakis_ComplexityComputingNash_2006}, but more
work has to been done in order to determine whether this still holds for bipolar colouring.


The reduction described above can work with any dimensionality.
and we know $forall n \in \mathbb{N}_{\geq 2}$, Chen et al. showed that
$\textsc{nD-StrongSperner}$ is still \textit{PPAD-Hard} in \cite{chen_SettlingComplexityComputing_2009}.
Therefore the following corollary holds \ref{cor:pars-bounds}

\begin{corollarybox}{\scn{nD-StrongSperner} parsimonious reduction bounds}{pars-bounds}
    \begin{gather*}
        f(\cdot) = 1 + \sum_{i = 1}^{n - 1}\binom{n}{i} = 2^n - 1 = a_n \\
        \scn{\#nD-StrongSperner} \subseteq^{a_n} \scn{\#PureCircuit}
    \end{gather*}
\end{corollarybox}


% Core breakthorugh came from the utilisation of the hazard-freeness from \cite{ikenmeyer_ComplexityHazardfreeCircuits_2019},
% as well as studying some problems in EOPL and UEOPL or more specifically the
% One-Permutation Discrete map. Athough in the end we were not able to extract any significantlly
% useful results out of it, its key observations were enough.

%
% \paragraph*{Useful Corollaries}

%
% To complete our last part of the theorem, it suffices to make use
% of the parsimonious reduction $\textsc{EndOfLine}$  to $\textsc{2D-StrongSperner}$ that Chen et al. \cite{chen_SettlingComplexityComputing_2009}.
% It has to be denoted that a similar reduction was made by
% Daskalakis et al. \cite{daskalakis_ComplexityComputingNash_2006}, where
% he reduced $\textsc{EndOfLine}$ to $\textsc{3D-StrongSperner}$ parsimoniously
% with similar ideas.
% For our theorem we will refer to the $\textsc{2D-StrongSperner}$ reduction and
% conclude with the theorem.
%
%
% \begin{theorem}[From $\scn{EndOfLine}$ to $\scn{PureCircuit}$]
% $$
% \scn{\#EndOfLine} -1 \subseteq \scn{\#2D-StrongSperner} -1 \subseteq^5 \scn{\#PureCircuit} -1
% $$
% \end{theorem}
%
% \subsubsection{Hazard-Free Logic Findings}
%
% Whilst trying to tackle the main objectives of the dissertation, we stumbled upon
% several interest relations across Hazard. We will use the notion of
% promise problems to show the following relation. First we will
% define a variant of UnSAT hazard as explained in \cite{ikenmeyer_ComplexityHazardfreeCircuits_2019}.
%
% \begin{definition}
%     Given a circuit $C$ that computes $f : \mathbb{B}^n \to \mathbb{B}$ such that
%     $\forall x \in \mathbb{B}^n : f(x) = 0$, find $\bar{x} \in \mathbb{T}^n$ such that
%     $C(\bar{x}) = \bot$. We assume that $\forall x \in \mathbb{B}^n: C(x) = 0$.
% \end{definition}
%
% Given the idea above we propose the following:
%
% \begin{proposition}
%     $$
%         \scn{\#PromiseUnsatHazard} \subseteq  \scn{\#PureCircuit} -1
%     $$
% \end{proposition}
%
% For the purposes of the current reduction, we will use the same \textsc{Purify} values
% $(0,1), (0,\bot), (1,\bot), (\bot, 1)$
%
% \paragraph{Construction}
% We start with a single node $s$. We create $n$ copies of \textsc{Purify}, where all 
% use $s$ as the input. From each purify gate we use the left output and
% create a vector $\hat{x} \in \mathbb{T}^n$ and pass them
% onto $C$ which will output onto a node $o$. We copy the output onto $s$.
% The above description can be summarised in the following figure \ref{fig:unsat-proof}.
%
% \begin{figure}[h!]
%     \centering
%         \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{assets/circuit-unsat.png}
%     \caption{Pure Circuit construction}
%     \label{fig:unsat-proof}
% \end{figure}
%
% \begin{proof}
% To prove our counting argument, we can make the following observation:
% If $o = 0$, we are computing $C(0^n) = 0$, which is the one guaranteed solution.
% We know that $o \neq 1$, therefore the only other possible solutions are $\bar{x} \in \mathbb{T}^n: C(\bar{x}) = \bot$.
% We also know from our construction of our \textsc{Purify} gate values, that our highlighted nodes
%     can take values $\{0,1,\bot\}$. Therefore, given that $\hat{x} \in \mathbb{T}^n$,
% our construction can find all possible solutions.
% \end{proof}
%

\subsubsection{Hazard Circuits and Tarski}
We define the following subclass of \textsc{Tarski} \ref{def:tarski-ppad}:


\begin{definitionbox}{$\scn{KleeneTarski}$ problem definition}{kleene-tarski}
    Given $F: \mathbb{T}^n \to \mathbb{T}^n$, where $F$ is a \textit{natural} function,
    we want to find the set of points $\textbf{Fix}^\star$ such that
    $$
        \forall x \in \textbf{Fix}^\star: F(x)  = x
    $$
    We assume $F$ will be represented as a circuit, that uses
    $\{*, +, \neg, \mathbf{0}, \mathbf{1}\}$.
\end{definitionbox}


\begin{proposition}[Parsimonious Reduction between $\scn{KleeneTarski}$ and $\scn{PureCircuit}$]
    $$
    \scn{\#KleeneTarski} \subseteq \scn{\#PureCircuit}
    $$
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Given an input circuit $C$, consturct $\textsc{PureCircuit}$ instance:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Initiate a vector of nodes $s$
    \item Apply $C(x)$ and store result on output vector $o$.
    \item Copy the results back into $s$
\end{enumerate}

We can observe that for any valid assignment, $\mathbf{x}[s]= \mathbf{x}[o]$.
Therefore, our construction can find all fix points for Kleene Circuits.
\end{proof}

% \subsubsection{Reductions to the EndOfLine}
%
% One can also attempt to make some reductions to the \textsc{EndOfLine}. It has to be noted,
% that we assume that there are no parsimonious reductions to the \textsc{EndOfLine},
% but we were able to construct some variants that allows to make there reductions.
% They key insights for this comes from the \textsc{PPAD}-inclusion proof
% by Deligkas et al. \cite{deligkas_PureCircuitTightInapproximability_2024}, where they
% showed that we can reduce PureCircuit, to \textit{Brouwer} problem by constructing
% a continuous function $F: [0,1]^n \to [0,1]^n$ as such: For each $v \in V$, we create
% continuous functions $f_i(\cdot): [0,1]^n \to [0,1]$ where we take thne input of vector
% of all the nodes and output the value of the current node
% \begin{enumerate}
%     \item If $v \in V$ is the output of a $\textsc{NOR}$ gate with inputs $x_1, x_2$, then we have:
%         $$
%         f_v(\mathbf{x}) := (1 - \mathbf{x}_{x_1}) \cdot (1 - \mathbf{x}_{x_2})
%         $$
%     \item If $y_1, y_2$ are the outputs of a  $\textsc{Purify}$ gate with $z$ as input, then we have:
%         \begin{align*}
%             f_{y_1}(\mathbf{x}) &:= \max\{2 \cdot \mathbf{x}_{z} - 1, 0\}\\
%             f_{y_2}(\mathbf{x}) &:= \min\{2 \cdot \mathbf{x}_{z}, 1\}
%         \end{align*}
% \end{enumerate}
% If $F(x) = x$, then we also found a solution for \textsc{PureCircuit} by:
% $$
% \forall v \in V: \mathbf{x}[v] = \begin{cases}
%     0 & \mathbf{x}[v] = 0 \\
%     \bot & 0 < \mathbf{x}[v] < 1 \\
%     1 & \mathbf{x}[v] = 1 \\
% \end{cases}
% $$
% Given that as an assumption we can restrict our \textit{Purify} gate
% to outputs $(0,\bot), (0,1), (\bot, 1)$. Using that we can define two types of variants
% of \textsc{PureCircuit} that are parsimoniously reducible to \textsc{SourceOrPresink}.
% We first define \textsc{SourceOrPresink} as:
%
% \begin{definition}[$\scn{SourceOrPresink}$ definition]
%     A $\scn{SourceOrPresink}$ is defined by the same construction as the $\scn{EndOfLine}$ 
%     but the solutions are sources and predecessors of sinks. If a node is both a source
%     and a presink, then we count it once.
% \end{definition}
%
% We will annotate our \textit{Purify} gates with an additional bit $b \in \mathbb{B}$ such that
% $$
% \forall x \in \mathbb{T}, y_1, y_2 \in \mathbb{T}: \textsc{Purify}^b(x) = (y_1,y_2) \implies \textsc{Purify}^{\neg {b}}(x) = (y_2, y_1)
% $$
% We can create two types of problems based on the annotation:
% \begin{enumerate}
%     \item Acyclic \textsc{PureCircuit}: Our instance is acyclic
%     \item Permutation-free \textsc{PureCircuit}: The outputs of a pure circuit, are connected to a circuit such that any permutation of the inputs
%         retains the result. More formally:
%         $$
%         \forall x \in \mathbb{T}^n, \sigma \in \mathcal{A}: C(\sigma(x)) = C(x)
%         $$
%         Where $\mathcal{A}$ is the set of automorphisms of $[n] \to [n]$.
%         The above description can be depicted in the following figure:
%         (ADD FIGURE)
% \end{enumerate}
%
% We can show that above variants we can create the following proposition (ref).
% To prove the reduction we can need to argue that we can go from one solution to another.
% The core idea of these problems is:  if we find a solution given in 
% a set of configurations $\gamma \in \{0,1\}^p$ where $p$ are the number of purify gates,
% we can match it with an additional solution where our set of configurations is $\neg \gamma$.
% This can be visualised as such: If the flip does not affect the inputs then we
% can create the following graph:

% \subsubsection{Next steps}
%
% Our next steps will focus mainly on two directions. One is lowering the bound as we declare in our conjecture with the
% usage of snake embeddings. We believe that each dimension can be parsimoniously reduced with another. This implies
% that, if we can show that $\forall n \in \mathbb{N}_{\geq 3}: \textsc{\#nD-StrongSperner} \subseteq \textsc{\#2D-StrongSperner}$
% we get to prove our conjecture.
%
%
% With regards to, our second direction, we want to emphasize on the hardness of \textsc{PureCircuit}.
% Or more specifically we will investigate as to if any of the following statements hold true.
%
% \begin{gather*}
%     \exists n, \alpha \in \mathbb{N}_{\geq 2}:
%     \textsc{\#SourceOrExcess}(\alpha,1) - 1  \subseteq \textsc{\#nD-StrongSperner} -1 \\
%     \exists n \in \mathbb{N}_{\geq 2}: \textsc{\#SourceOrExcess}(n,1) - 1 \subseteq \textsc{\#PureCircuit} -1 \\
% \end{gather*}
%
% We believe the above two should be our next steps in order to get close to the main question of our project.
% Ideally generalising, the above reductions to the infinity hierarchy of
% $\textsc{\#SourceOrExcess}(\cdot,1)$ would be ideal as it may lead to finding an overall upper bound
% towards the entire $\textsc{\#PPAD} -1$ class.
