\subsection{Reflections}

Overall, the current project progressed as anticipated. We managed to keep
consistent progress in both theory and development aspect. In addition,
due to the theoretical overlap the project has with other fields, we
were able to experiment with great variety of problems as well as
develop research methodologies for tackling these problems.

Of course understanding how to conduct such research came with a lot of trials and error.
We quickly realised that such projects require a much more extensive literature review than anticipated.
Moreover, when it comes to theorising and proof development, we faced many failures.
Often, we spent an excessive amount of time working on a problem without being methodical.
From that, we understood that when trying to prove statements, it is often more beneficial
exploring the field as a whole, tackling various problems and gathering ideas from each.
Moreover, each failed attempt allows us to understand a problem in greater depth, how it behaves
and how to formulate our attempt to increase our chances.
This can be observed in, we will analyze this is greater depth.ur canvas board \ref{fig:theory:obsidian-canvas}, where we
used ``whiteboard'' approach to keep track of the project from a bird's-eye view. 
We hope to use this exploratory methodology to uncover even more mysteries that surround
the complexity of counting problems.


% Over the last couple of months I made a lot of mistakes whilst working with the project.
% Was just not focusing enough or spending enough time to do the necessary research needed
% to comprehend the topic. Moreover, I spent time focusing on the wrong aspects of my assignment.
% An example of that is referred to the sections were we showed variants of our pure circuit
% that have a combinatorial interpretation. Another core issue I faced was the lack
% of experience when dealing with more theoretical based project. This led me to
% trying to tackle the problem head on without exploring alternative avenues. For example 
% we can observe that our main reduction from the \textit{EndOfLine} came
% when using topological problems instead.

% \subsection{Lessons Learned}
%
% Up to the current phase of our project, we were able to gather several important takeaways.
% Exploring the literature and trying to work the problem under different perspectives
% may lead to potential breakthroughs. The main catalyst to our core finding, came
% when looking into problems such as \textsc{EOPL} or more specifically
% the \textsc{OPDC} problem, described by Fernley et al. \cite{fearnley_UniqueEndPotential_2020}.
% \textsc{OPDC} can be described as a simpler version of the traditonal n-dimensional Brouwer problem
% where instead, we have a unqiue fixed point and our function will point towards the unique solution.
% Moreover, deeper look into Kleene-logic or more specifically \textit{Hazard-free} circuits allowed
% us to exploit the $\bot$ value to compute multiple input simultaneously \cite{ikenmeyer_ComplexityHazardfreeCircuits_2019}.

% Using the two aforementioned observations as well as looking at the original reduction again allowed us to achieve
% the desired breakthrough.
%
% In order to accomplish the above research, we have also learned how to research more effectively.
% Exploitation of LLMs such as \texttt{ChatGPT}, \texttt{Perplexity} and more, we are able to
% approach the problem from multiple perspectives. Moreover, thought organisation and cataloguing with
% \texttt{Obsidian}
% also came crucial when handling a large volume of ideas and information over a long period of time,
% as explained in the previous sections. Last but not least, utilisation of books,
% related research and textbooks also came important when it came to theory crafting and idea extraction.
%
% Last but not least, the general approach to the project changed over the course of time.
% Understanding that the journey of discovery as important as the discovery itself,
% made the project more enjoyable. Having the freedom to explore areas and expand
% the horizons of what we know, is what keeps this project exhilarating.
% Ultimately, this mindset helped the project stay engaging and allowed for continuous learning throughout.
