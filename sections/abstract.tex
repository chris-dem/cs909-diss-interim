In the world of combinatronics, one often looks for the combinatronic interpretation between numbers.
Recently, through the works of Igor Pak and other researchers, people have decided
to combine the worlds of counting complexity theory with combinatronics to give formal
definition to this idea \cite{ikenmeyer_WhatWhatNot_2022, ikenmeyer_PositivitySymmetricGroup_2024, pak_WhatCombinatorialInterpretation_2022}. 
Our project focuses on analysing the combinatorial properties of $\textsc{PPAD} -1$ using
the \textsc{PureCircuit} problem as well as developing a visualisation tool for it. In this report, we give a progress report as to the work that 
we have done as well as talk about notable results such as parsimonious reductions between Sperner problems to
\textsc{PureCircuit} up to some constant bound.
