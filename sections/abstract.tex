This project investigates the combinatorial structure of the \textsc{PureCircuit} problem.
We conjecture that its circuit-based formulation can provide insights and bounds on the counting complexity of \textsc{PPAD-1}.
In this report, we present the progress made so far, including preliminary results and ongoing developments.
In addtion, we report on the construction of a visualisation tool designed to support the exploration and formulation of these combinatorial theorems.
Lastly we outline the current state of the project and describe our intended next steps.
